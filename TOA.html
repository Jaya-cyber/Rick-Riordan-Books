			Summary
		</h2>
		<p>
			The Trials of Apollo series, written by Rick Riordan, follows the misadventures of Apollo, the Greek god of the sun, music, and prophecy, who has been cast down to Earth by Zeus as a mortal teenager named Lester Papadopoulos. Stripped of his divine powers and stuck in the body of a regular human, Apollo must navigate the modern world while also facing numerous trials and challenges.

To regain his godhood, Apollo must embark on a series of quests, accompanied by a diverse group of demigods and mortals who become his allies. Along the way, Apollo learns valuable lessons about humility, friendship, and the consequences of his past actions. The series also delves into the consequences of the gods' actions on mortals and the complexities of ancient prophecies that continue to affect the lives of both gods and humans.

With Riordan's signature blend of humor, action, and mythology, The Trials of Apollo series offers readers an engaging and humorous exploration of Greek mythology in a contemporary setting. Through Apollo's journey of self-discovery and redemption, the series explores themes of identity, responsibility, and the enduring power of hope in the face of daunting challenges.
