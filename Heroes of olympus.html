			Summary
		</h2>
		<p>
			The Heroes of Olympus series by Rick Riordan continues the story from the Percy Jackson series, expanding into a new epic adventure. Set in a world where Greek and Roman mythology intersect, the series introduces a new group of demigods—both Greek and Roman—who must unite to face an ancient and formidable threat: the awakening of the Earth goddess, Gaea.

The series follows seven demigods: Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, Jason Grace, Piper McLean, Leo Valdez, Hazel Levesque, and Frank Zhang. Together, they embark on a quest to prevent Gaea from overthrowing the gods and plunging the world into chaos. Along the way, they encounter new allies, face deadly challenges, and uncover long-hidden secrets about their own heritage and the origins of their powers.

The Heroes of Olympus series expands on the themes of friendship, teamwork, and the struggle between destiny and free will. With Riordan's signature blend of humor, action, and mythology, the series captivates readers with its fast-paced plot and diverse characters. It seamlessly integrates elements of Greek and Roman mythology into a modern-day setting, offering a thrilling and educational journey through ancient legends and contemporary challenges.
